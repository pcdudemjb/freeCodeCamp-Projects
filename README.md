# freeCodeCamp-Projects
This is the compilation of all the projects I've completed from freeCodeCamp's various certification programs.

I have added additional code to some of these projects to provide user input capabilities.

Also, please note that this is not the exact code I used to complete the projects for the programs.
At the time of completing these, freeCodeCamp was utilizing replit.com for testing (ensuring that all parameters of the project were met).
I have not saved/included the testing modules or code used for that and wanted these projects to all run independently.
